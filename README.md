This project, my first HTML project, involved designing a website that features a homepage with links to three pages, each containing a recipe.
To complete this project, I used HTML5, including using language attributes, meta elements, title elements, etc. I demonstrated competence in using headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and relative links, and image elements. I also practiced using character entities to display reserved characters in text.
I utilized a Linux Xubuntu terminal to create new directories and files for this project, copying, moving, renaming, and removing files as necessary. I also used git for my version control system (VCS), which helped me practice writing commit messages as well. Github served as the host for the project's repository.
