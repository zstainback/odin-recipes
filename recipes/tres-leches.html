        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe produces a soft and fluffy wet cake in
            authentic latin style! As the name suggests, the cake 
            is soaked in three milks, adding extra moisture and sweentess
            to this tasy treat. The cake is topped with whipped cream,
            sliced strawberries, and a dusting of cinnamon.
